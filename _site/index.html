<p>The difference between software engineering and programming is professionalism and consistency ultimately software engineering can be defined as programming integrated over time. What can someone do to make a code sustainable and improve upon in the future what are some tools that can be used to make something more efficient all of this is software engineering. There are three things to take into account according to The section <strong>Programming Overtime</strong> in the book Software Engineering at Google.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How the code will need to be changed over its lifetime</p></li>
<li><p>How you will have to adapt as things change and evolve</p></li>
<li><p>Take into account Time change Scale and growth when making a decision.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="use-case" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case">Use-case</h3>
<p>I believe this way of thinking is not only beneficial to Chasten but almost any software engineering project in general because, at the end of the day, all it’s saying is to expect things to change. And how you need to make decisions which means you may not be able to do everything you wanted to which I feel should be somewhat expected a lot of the time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se2-what-is-software-engineering"><strong>SE2</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch01.html">What is Software Engineering?</a></h2>
<p>Once again Software Engineering is defined as programming over time but this time in more detail. While a programming project might be a single-person endeavor a software engineering project is a team effort. Teamwork is very important for these types of projects as while working as a team can have its issues the amount you can do with more people is much greater. You have to take into account problems and changes to the software appearing as it is being made and when it is already released. You need to make trade-offs between how much money or time something is gonna cost and how much benefit it will have for the software. A software engineering project is expected to last for years and with that needs to be amiable to changes as maybe the dependencies it uses to change the OS changes and also competition at least at a large scale that might arise to not be overshadowed by superior software.</p>
<section id="use-case-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-1">Use-Case</h3>
<p>This way of thinking while I don’t think entirely applicable to chasten I think the importance of working together and taking into account how things change is very important especially since overall we seem to be having problems working together and being organized. This has led to things not being done on time and multiple people being confused about what they should do and what they are doing. So I think communication with each other is very important for chasten and software in general and after that comes the more complicated questions on how chasten may change over time how long we want it to last and how amicable it is are second to teamwork.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se3-how-to-work-well-on-teams"><strong>SE3</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch02.html">How to Work Well on Teams</a></h2>
<p>Teamwork is an important aspect of Software Engineering almost every major accomplishment in Software Engineering was accomplished by groups of people, not one person by themselves. While Linus Torvalds created the framework for Linux the vast majority of its current form was made by other people there is not just one person who’s good at everything many people are required to make something truly great even if you might consider someone a genius. It doesn’t require a genius to make something important just a team of individuals who communicate, cooperate and criticize to get the best possible product or result. Michael Jordan didn’t win six championships as an individual he one them as a part of the Chicago Bulls basketball team.</p>
<section id="use-case-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-2">Use-Case</h3>
<p>This is very important to keep in mind two minds are better than one you aren’t going to be able to do everything on your own. For chasten, while it’s not the largest project it is certainly not something we can achieve as individuals almost everything we do can affect someone else’s work making it important that we communicate what we are doing and why we are doing it. Things get done faster and often better when working together.</p>

<section id="se4-knowledge-sharing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se4-knowledge-sharing"><strong>SE4</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html">Knowledge Sharing</a></h2>
<p>People in your organization or team should understand the problems of your software better than the internet. Often what happens is people withhold information so people will have a lot of information about a certain part but when they need to work with a different part of the program they don’t have the knowledge needed to work efficiently. This is not what you want you want everyone to be properly educated on the software they’re working on. This also causes people working in the same team to do things differently because they have different information which can cause conflicts and confusion slowing down the process of making a proper software program. Relating to the bus factor if one person has all the information on a subject and they get hit by a bus all the information is gone setting the project back significantly depending on what that person withheld then having to need people figure it out for themselves.</p>
<section id="use-case-3" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-3">Use-Case</h3>
<p>With Chasten, a lot of people only have information on certain parts of the software and this causes problems when these people aren’t present as then we have no information on possibly a major part of the program leaving everyone I guess what is going on. Some people barely know the basics of the program so they may be assigned to a task and making very little progress because they don’t have the information required and no one would know as it’s not communicated.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se5-engineering-for-equity"><strong>SE5</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch04.html">Engineering for Equity</a></h2>
<p>Often with Software engineering especially on a large scale as in something like Google, it is important to keep in mind the broad amount of people that will be using your product. You need to make sure you are aware of some cultural differences and are proactive about finding and discovering problems in your software that may not affect you directly. A good example is brought up in this chapter where a software engineer found that Google image search algorithms would have black people show up when searching gorilla which is very bad. This was a major oversight from Google and is a result of them not including enough data on underrepresented people and just didn’t think this could be an issue. It’s also important to realize not everyone who uses your software is an expert so it should be easy to use and understand or at least fairly intuitive. If it’s not then you objectively have a bad product that may be clunky to use and has unintended issues that may anger people or offend them.</p>
<section id="use-case-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-4">Use-Case</h3>
<p>I think within this class I think the idea of thinking about who is using your software is very important and expecting many different types of people to use it. And while there probably won’t be anything as serious as what happened with Google it’s still important to design software with other people in mind not just the ones making it.</p>

<section id="se6-how-to-lead-a-team" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se6-how-to-lead-a-team"><strong>SE6</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch05.html">How to Lead a Team</a></h2>
<p>In a software engineering team there needs to be some form of leader otherwise the team may be directionless and unorganized. While it is good to have everyone to contribute to conversations you can’t have everyone lead themselves as this causes groups to be disjointed and inefficient. It’s important to have someone to make sure things are getting done teams are properly staffed to fix an issue or add a feature. A lot of people avoid taking on a manager type of role because they often feel like they didn’t do anything because you’ll often be written less code. It also is significantly more responsibilty and in return stress.</p>
<section id="use-case-5" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-5">Use-case</h3>
<p>I think having a leader would be very important for the class and while we do technically have leaders they change everyweek which leads to different things being the focus each week or there not being a focus at all leading to nothing really getting done at a reasonable pace. The leaders being changed everyweek also causes people who may not be ready for that responsibility and there being forced into that situation which is fine in a classroom circumstance because it’s relativly low stakes but I believe it’s partially one of the reasons alot of issues have taken alot longer than expected to fix.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se7-leading-at-scale"><strong>SE7</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch06.html">Leading at Scale</a></h2>
<p>The more you move up in a leadership possions the less your technical abiltitys and understanding of the project really matter. The farther up you go the more broad problems you will be asked to handle but they won’t be as deep as ones your used to solving. You also need to make trade-offs as a leader its important to understand everything has a give and take. It’s important that you can be making these descisions and understand why they need to be made. You’ll be constantly having to make new descicions and its important to make the best descisions you possibly can with maybe not the best understanding of the situation and its your job to guide the total direction of the group.</p>
<section id="use-case-6" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-6">Use-case</h3>
<p>There isn’t really much of a Useful thing for us specifically right now because the scale will never be that large but the overall concept of what it means to be an effective leader is important for people to understand in general. It’s also important understand what taking on a leadership position actually implies and the types of responsibilties you will have and be expected to deal with.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se8-style-guides-and-rules"><strong>SE8</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch08.html">Style Guides and Rules</a></h2>
<p>This chapter talks about the idea of having rules for how people in an orginization code. This can be something like naming conventions how certain parts of code are written how things are defined. This is used so that people can avoid using bad habits or making some sort of error at least in the context of the organization. It can also be a way to promote consistency with in code if a similar issue is solved in two different ways that’s not inherently bad but it is when striving for consistency in code. Having rules can make everyone start to code in a similar way and format making it easier to communicate and understand what code is supposed to do person to person. As mentioned in the article it is also important to not have to many rules as it can provide a bit of an overload of information and decrease efficiency the rules and principles should be relativly intuitive and easy to adapt too. They should not be something that activly hinders someone from completing a task or is simply unpractical. Overall rules and guidelines can help improve consistency communication and overall readability for everyone involved in the long run, but if taken too far can do the opposite and be a hinderance.</p>
<section id="use-case-7" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-7">Use-case</h3>
<p>We have already started to this in with our projects specifically with committing and creating pull requests and issues. For commiting were supposed to use the format where if where adding a feature its feat: random_feature and for pull requests and issues theres a frame work that is supposed to be followed that is shown when creating either of them. We even have linters that help define some formatting rules automatically like Black and Ruff which everyones code has to adhear to those standards for the most part or it will fail the build. Although in some of these cases it’s not always clear on what are rules for example me personally I didn’t know we where supposed to write our commit messages in a certain format until a couple weeks in. So communicating what the rules are but other than that I feel that these concepts for the most part are already implemented.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se9-code-review"><strong>SE9</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch09.html">Code Review</a></h2>
<p>Code review is an important part of software engineering it’s important for your code to be reviewed bny other before they effect the main repo for the project. At google this takes the form of making comments and people testing the changes through snapshots and comparing the changes to the current version giving feedback or just providing more information. It’s important for other people to review your code as it gets another persons point of view and often expertise on it and can easily lead to more clean and efficient code and just a better project enviroment in general.</p>
<section id="use-case-8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-8">Use-case</h3>
<p>This is already used alot in this class you can’t merge anything with the main branch unless its reviewed by others and people do comment on and give feedback to changes. So alot of these concepts are already in use. I feel however that we can still do better it often feels like people review something and don’t have a real understanding of what it’s actually doing they just know it doesn’t break the build. I do this personally I don’t really to take the time to test the code myself and while I haven’t personally reviewed many peoples changes the ones I have i’ve rarely understood that well. So we can definitly be a little more helpful when it comes to reviewing in general but we definitaly follow alot of these concepts already.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se10-documentation"><strong>SE10</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch10.html">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>Documnetation is important because it helps spread information it’s easier to work on something if there is documnetation on how it works similar to a manual for something. It also makes it more efficient to work on something because everything is clearly outlined. Documentation is significantly more important for team based work than solo based but Documnetation on how your tool works should always be a thing because it allows you to explain how to use it and maybe give information on how to set it up if something isn’t working so more people can use the tool with less issues. When writing documnetation it’s important to keep in mind who your audience is and should generally focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<section id="use-case-9" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-9">Use-case</h3>
<p>Documnetation is very useful for anyprogramming project it allows you to work better and mroe efficiently in teams and also explain how something should work so people can find issues easier. It also just encourages better communication and reduces bus factor because the more information is documented the less reliant you are on one person knowing the answers so using more documnetation in projects would be very beneficial for us.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="se11-test-overview"><strong>SE11</strong> <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html">Test Overview</a></h2>
<p>Testing is an important aspect of writing a program everyone does it to varying degrees whether it’s manually running it to see if it has an expected outputs or have automatic tests set up through things like pytest. Testing is important because without it you really have no idea if your code works or is well designed. Not only do tests ensure a higher quality code base but it also improves your ability to make changes by allowing bugs to be found faster and more efficiently making them easier to fix.</p>
<section id="use-case-10" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-10">Use-case</h3>
<p>We already use test cases with chasten and cell-veyor and this concept is pretty basic to software engineering so I feel that we have already implemented this idea for the most part.</p>
