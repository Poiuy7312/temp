    "text": "SE2 What is Software Engineering?\nOnce again Software Engineering is defined as programming overtime but this time in more detail. While a programming project might be a single person endeavor a software engineering project is a team effort. Teamwork is very important for these types of projects as while working as a team can have it owns issues the amount you can do with more people is much greater. You have to take into account problems and changes to the software appearing as its being made and when its already released. You need to make trade offs between how much money or time something is gonna cost and how much benefit it will have for the software. A software engineering project is expected to last for years and with that needs to be amiable to changes as maybe the dependencies it uses change the OS changes and also competition at least at a large scale that might arise as to not be overshadowed by superior software.\n\nUse-Case\nThis way of thinking while I don’t think entirely applicable to chasten I think the importance of working together and take into account how things change is very important especially since overall we seem to be having problems working together and being organized. This has lead to things not being done on time multiple people being confused on what they should do and what they are doing. So I think communication with each other is very important for chasten and software in general and after that comes the more complicated questions on how chasten may change overtime how long do we want it to last and how amicable it is are second to teamwork."

While Linus Torvalds created the framework for Linux the vast majority of its current form was made by other people their is not just one person who’s good at everything many people are required to make something truelly great even if you might consider someone a genius. It doesn’t require a genius to make something important just a team of individuals who communicate, cooperate and criticize to get the best possible product or result. Michael Jordan didn’t win six championships as an individual he one them as a part of the Chicago Bulls basketball team.\n\nUse-Case\nThis is very important to keep in mind two minds are better then one you aren’t going to be able to do everything on your own. For chasten while its not the largest project it certainly not something we can achieve as individuals almost everything we do can effect someone elses work making it important that we communicate what where doing and why were doing it. Things get done faster and often better when working together."

    "text": "FB3 Fuzzing\nThe basic idea of fuzzing is to test as many possible reasonable inputs as possible so if you have a function that is supposed to receive a string. Then you can create a fuzzing generator that creates a string of random characters and with that and a runner to run the code you can test the limits of that specific function or program. This is a great way to test your code with unorthodox inputs and while they may be unlikely it can still help find. greater problems like let’s say you have a program that can only take a certain length of string before it crashes or if you’re doing something with math and a weird number or abnormally large number causes crashes or bugs. A fuzzer is a great way to help find these issues as there are so many different numbers and characters that can possibly be used by the code as inputs that having something to just check as many possibilities as possible can help improve the programs efficiency and robustness.\n\nThe FuzzingBook has a great example of a basic fuzzer:\ndef fuzzer(max_length: int = 100, char_start: int = 32, char_range: int = 32) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"A string of up to `max_length` characters\n       in the range [`char_start`, `char_start` + `char_range`)\"\"\"\n    string_length = random.randrange(0, max_length + 1)\n    out = \"\"\n    for i in range(0, string_length):\n        out += chr(random.randrange(char_start, char_start + char_range))\n    return out\n\n\nUse-case\nThis can be a very useful concept for helping to uncover bugs as in my experience with chasten I’ve found a lot of bugs by just running the program with expected outputs. So, I can only imagine how many there are when there’s a lot of information it must sort through or when there’s an unexpected input which isn’t necessarily a bug, but it very well could be and the concept of something checking multiple different inputs and possibilities may help uncover many obscure bug and issues."

    "text": "SE4 Knowledge Sharing\nPeople in your organization or team should understand the problems of your software better than the internet. Often what happens is people with hold information so people will have a lot of information of a certain part but when they need to work with a different part of the program they don’t have the knowledge needed to work efficiently. This is not what you want you want everyone to be properly educated on the software there working on. This also causes people working in the same team to do things differently because they have different information which can cause conflicts and confusion slowing down the process of making a proper software program. Relating to the bus factor if one person has all information on a subject and they get hit by a bus all the information is gone setting the project back significantly depending on what that person withheld then having to need people figure it out for themselves.\n\nUse-Case\nWith Chasten alot of people only have information on certain parts of the software and this causes problems when these people aren’t present as then we have no information on possibly a major part of the program leaving everyone guessing what is going on. Some people barely know the basics of the program so they may be assigned to a task and making very little progress because they don’t have the information required and no-one would know as it’s not communicated."
