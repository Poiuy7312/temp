## **DB1** Introduction to Debugging

The first chapter of the debugging book mostly goes over the basics of debugging and different ways to detect a bug it talks
about printf debugging which is when you put print statements in your code to help you keep track of what's going on it mentions
this method is very inefficient. It also talks about that when debugging you need to solve the cause not the symptom so if you see
a bug for a certain input you can't just fix it for that specific input you need to fix the problem in general which means finding the
root cause. Which this chapter suggests doing through the scientific method ask a question of why something isn't working come up with
a theory figure out how you can test it test it and repeat until you find the issue.

### Use-case

This is obviously useful because it just broad debugging concepts and thing to keep in mind when doing it. It's not something you can't
really figure out on your own and there's nothing in this chapter that is particurly complicated so implmenting the concepts can be almost
immediate if they aren't already.
