## **DB1** Introduction to Debugging

The first chapter of the debugging book mostly goes over the basics of debugging and different ways to detect a bug it talks
about printf debugging which is when you put print statements in your code to help you keep track of what's going on it mentions
this method is very inefficient. It also talks about that when debugging you need to solve the cause not the symptom so if you see
a bug for a certain input you can't just fix it for that specific input you need to fix the problem in general which means finding the
root cause. Which this chapter suggests doing through the scientific method ask a question of why something isn't working come up with
a theory figure out how you can test it test it and repeat until you find the issue.

### Use-case

This is obviously useful because it just broad debugging concepts and thing to keep in mind when doing it. It's not something you can't
really figure out on your own and there's nothing in this chapter that is particurly complicated so implmenting the concepts can be almost
immediate if they aren't already.

## **DB2** Tracing Executions

Tracing a programs execution is to help with debugging by showing the step the program took when running and if there was a crash it allows
you to look through the steps and see where it failed and fix the root cause of the problem more effectivly a simple way you can do this
is to use sys.settrace() function which traces everyline of code run and prints it but this can sometimes give you to much information so you
may want something a little more limited. an example of this

```python
def remove_html_markup_traced(s):  # type: ignore
    sys.settrace(traceit)
    ret = remove_html_markup(s)
    sys.settrace(None)
    return ret
```
This will trace the the remove_html_markup function and print out the results even if the code crashes it will show you everything that ran.
As stated before this is very useful because it makes finding the cause of a bug significantly easier and more convenient.

### Use-case

At least with chasten most of the test cases actually do get traced in fact the ones that use hypothesis are automaticlly traced by hypothesis so this type of thing is already for the most part implemented. So all we really would want is have non hypothesis functions traced but other than that this concept is already implemented for the most part.
